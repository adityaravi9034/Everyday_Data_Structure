An array is defined as a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. 
It is the simplest data structure where each element of the array can be accessed by using its index.

Properties of arrays

● Each element of the array is of the same data type and same size. For example:For an array of integers with the int data type, each element of the array will
  occupy 4 bytes.
● Elements of the array are stored in contiguous memory locations. For example : 200 is the starting address (base address) assigned to the first element of the array and
  each element of the array is of integer data type occupying 4 bytes in memory.


Where can arrays be used?
● Arrays should be used where the number of elements to be stored is already
known.
● Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a
related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
● Generally, when we require very fast access times, we usually prefer arrays
since they provide O(1) access times.
● Arrays work well when we have to organize data in multidimensional format.
We can declare arrays of as many dimensions as we want.
● If the index of the element to be modified is known beforehand, it can be
efficiently modified using arrays due to quick access time and mutability
